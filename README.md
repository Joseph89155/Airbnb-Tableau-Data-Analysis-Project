## 🏘️ Airbnb Data Analysis Project.

## 📋 Project Description.
This Tableau project focuses on analyzing Airbnb listing data to explore price variations, listing distribution, and revenue trends across Seattle. Using Tableau Desktop, I prepared, analyzed, and visualized the data to uncover valuable insights into pricing patterns by bedroom count, geographic location (zipcode), and seasonality throughout the year.

## 🎯 Project Objective.
Analyze Airbnb listing data to:
- Understand how price varies by number of bedrooms.
- Compare average listing prices across different zipcodes.
- Track revenue trends over time.
- Provide insights to optimize pricing and improve profitability for Airbnb hosts.

## Dataset used.
- <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/alexanderfreberg/airbnb-listings-2016-dataset">Dataset</a>

## ❓ Questions (KPIs)
- What is the average price per number of bedrooms?
- How are listings distributed across different bedroom counts?
- Which zipcodes have the highest and lowest average listing prices?
- How does revenue trend across the calendar year?
- Are there specific neighborhoods or times of year that are more profitable?

## 🛠️ Process
Data Preparation:
- Cleaned and structured the dataset for analysis (handled nulls, data types, etc.).
- Aggregated and filtered data by bedroom count, zipcode, and calendar date.

Data Analysis & Visualization:
- Built visualizations for average price per bedroom.
- Mapped listing prices geographically by zipcode using filled maps.
- Created bar charts for price distribution across zipcodes.
- Tracked revenue performance over time using a line chart.

Dashboard Creation:
- Combined visuals into an interactive, easy-to-read dashboard.
- Included tooltips and labels for deeper insight into each chart.
- Ensured filter and layout consistency for user-friendly navigation.

## 🔍 Project Insights
- Bedroom Count: Listings with more bedrooms have a significantly higher average price, peaking at over $580 for 6-bedroom properties.
- Zipcodes: Areas like 98109 and 98102 command the highest average prices, while others like 98178 and 98168 offer lower-priced listings.
- Listing Distribution: The majority of listings are 1-bedroom properties, followed by 2 and 3 bedrooms.
- Revenue Trends: Revenue shows strong seasonal variation, with a steady climb early in the year and notable peaks around spring and summer.

## 🏁 Final Conclusion
To improve profitability and optimize listing strategies:
Focus on larger properties (4+ bedrooms) in high-demand zipcodes such as 98109 and 98102.
Adjust pricing seasonally, especially ahead of high-revenue periods like spring and summer.
For new hosts, targeting 1–2 bedroom listings in high-price areas can be a strategic entry point.
Geographic and seasonal trends should be integrated into dynamic pricing models to maximize revenue.
This data-driven approach helps Airbnb hosts and property managers make smarter, location-specific decisions that align with market behavior and demand.
