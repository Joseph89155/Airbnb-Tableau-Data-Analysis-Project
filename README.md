# Airbnb-Tableau-Data-Analysis-Project
This Tableau project explores Airbnb listing data from Seattle to identify pricing patterns, revenue trends, and geographic insights. Using interactive dashboards, it breaks down average prices by bedroom count and zip code, and tracks revenue performance over timeâ€”helping hosts make smarter, data-driven pricing decisions.
